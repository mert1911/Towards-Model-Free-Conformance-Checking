# Towards-Model-Free-Conformance-Checking

### Usage of this repository
This repository is supposed to help to reproduce the work in the paper "Towards Model-Free Conformance Checking: Assessing Trace Conformance Based on Few Annotated Variants". With
this work, we aim to move towards model-free conformance checking and enable managers to apply conformance checking even if no process model is available. We evaluated the applicability of various anomaly detection algorithms for conformance checking, using them as baseline approaches. Additionally, we employed the heuristic miner algorithm to discover a process model, which served as another baseline for conformance checking. Beyond these, we proposed a novel approach that leverages three conformance input traces, offering a unique solution for conformance checking.
